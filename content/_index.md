## âš¡ Fun fact
I got a wolf tattoo on my left arm in college, thinking wolves were solitary creatures that embodied strength and independence. Ironically, I later learned that wolves are highly social animals that live in tight-knit packs and rely on group cooperation for hunting and survival. While my understanding was mistaken, the tattoo has taken on a different meaning â€“ reminding me that true strength often comes from community and collaboration. Ê•â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê”
