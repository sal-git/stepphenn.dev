## About Me
My name is Stephen Andrew Lightcap. I'm a software developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, primarily working with Python and JavaScript. I started this blog after stepping away from social media platforms (though I was never much of a poster) to create a more intentional space for sharing my experiences and thoughts.

This project is inspired by my nostalgia for the early internet era, when people crafted their own unique corners of the web. I actually started my tech journey with MySpace when modifying the templates for my page. I would create HTML pages that linked to other pages. I built a game in the 5th grade around hypertext links before I knew what Text Adventure games were (before my time).
